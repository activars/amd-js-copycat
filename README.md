# AMD JS Copycat

If you prefer to develop JavaScript with AMD module, this repository helps you to setup the project and create initial file structures.

## When should I use this?
* I only write pure javascript without template and css files
* I want to write in a modular way
* I want to use AMD
* I want the final JavaScript to be loaded on a site that may or may not have requireJS available
* I want the final JavaScript to be requirable

## Prerequisite
Almond.js is used to build smaller footprint AMD moduler JavaScript. It requires `node` and `npm` After the nmp is installed, run the following command to install latest `requirejs`.

```
npm install requirejs
```
